      Unfortunately, the “Winery” part of the logo is white and therefore not ideal for printing on light-colored paper. That’s why two versions of the logo are in the source code, one for screen display, one for printing. The latter image has no alt text, otherwise screen readers would repeat reading out “Smashing Winery.”

    Now let’s tweak some general settings for the fonts. Most browsers set the default to Times New Roman, because serif fonts are considered to be easier on the eyes when read on paper. We can use Georgia at 12-point font size and a slightly higher line height for better legibility.
